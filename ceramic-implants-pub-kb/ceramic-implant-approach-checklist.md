# Ceramic Dental Implant Clinic Evaluation Checklist

<https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/627f5f62-4ab2-4a1a-b197-3809877ecd80>

## Intro

**AI** created based on their research (so please double check on your own) a comprehensive ceramic dental implant evaluation checklist that's organized into three priority levels:

**Key Questions (9 items)** - These focus on the most critical aspects:
- Complete metal-free systems (including connection screws)
- Ceramic surgical instruments
- Material transparency and specifications
- Clinical experience with ceramic implants

**Medium Priority (8 items)** - Important quality indicators:
- Manufacturing standards and origin
- Biological enhancement techniques
- Training and certification
- Cost transparency and warranties

**Supplementary Questions (8 items)** - For those wanting a deeper evaluation:
- Advanced clinical protocols
- Material science understanding
- Patient support and education

The checklist includes various question formats (checkboxes, multiple choice, fill-in fields) and features a scoring guide with clear red and green flags. It's designed to be shared with dental professionals without bias, while effectively identifying clinics that meet the highest ceramic implant standards.

For those in a rush, focusing just on the Key Questions section will reveal whether a clinic truly offers 100% metal-free ceramic solutions or is among those making misleading claims about "ceramic" implants that actually contain titanium components.
